Notes on magnetic field calculations:To calculate magnetic fields1. Run bgeom by typing "bgeom". This will take a few minutes. You can reduce the time byspecifying a coarser mesh by changing nr and nz, but note resulting changes in calculated contours.The coil geometry data is contained in the "aspl_geom_2.mat" file which is loaded by bgeom.m.2. Specify currents, e.g, "cur=[120,100,600];".3. Run bprof2 by typing "bprof2".This will draw the flux tube map and mod |B| on axis.4. To run other currents, simply change the "cur" vector and run bprof2 again. This should run veryquickly.Notes:To change the |B| value at which the lower hybrid line is drawn, change the "lhres" variablein the bprof2.m command fileTo change the quartz tube and antenna location, change the relevant variables in bprof2.mThese are commented in the command file so you can figure out which ones to change.To change magnet positions, change Z0 appropriately and run bgeom again. The file geom_coaxial_coilsm.m explains Z0 and other variables. All files are commented, so you can figure outwhat all the variables are. Rick Gouldinggouldingrh@ornl.gov423-574-6480
