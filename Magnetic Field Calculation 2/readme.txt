Notes on magnetic field calculations:To calculate magnetic fields1. Run bgeom by typing "bgeom". This will take a few minutes. You can reduce the time byspecifying a coarser mesh by changing nr and nz, but note resulting changes in calculated contours.The coil geometry data is contained in the "proto_mpex_12coils_flat_field_highdens.mat" file which is loaded by bgeom.m.2. Specify currents, e.g, "cur=[120,100,600];".3. Run bprofm_12_coils_geo.m".This will draw the flux tube map and mod |B| on axis.4. To run other currents, simply change the "cur" vector and run bprofm_12_coils_geo.m again. This should run veryquickly.Notes:To change the quartz tube and antenna location, change the relevant variables in bprofm_12_coils_geo.m.mThese are commented in the command file so you can figure out which ones to change.To change magnet positions, change Z0 appropriately and run bgeom again. The file geom_coaxial_coilsm.m explains Z0 and other variables. All files are commented, so you can figure out what all the variables are. Rick Gouldinggouldingrh@ornl.gov865-576-6882
